## Task description
The task involves processing a large set of integers from a file and finding the following values:

1. Maximum number in the file
2. Minimum number in the file
3. Median
4. Average
5. Longest increasing sequence of numbers
6. Longest decreasing sequence of numbers

```
The proposed solution method should find all these values within 40 seconds
